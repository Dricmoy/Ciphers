4a. How many distinct keys, keys which each produce different ciphertexts for the same message, do each of the four ciphers have? 
Note: 
1. Only replace the "___" with your answer.
2. Any other change in the template might result in a potential mark deduction.

Original caesar cipher
  Answer: 26 (Number)
  Explanation: There are 26 characters in the alphabet that can be used as distinct keys/shifts for the same message (10-20 words)

Problem 1 implementation
  Answer: 52 (Number)
  Explanation: There are 52 distinct characters from the alphabet that can be used as keys/shifts for the same message (10-20 words)

Problem 2 implementation
  Answer: 52 (Number)
  Explanation: The first letter has 52 distinct keys and the ciphertexts produced for the same message depends on that letter (10-20 words)

Problem 3 implementation
  Answer: 52^n (Expression with n is the length of the keyword)
  Explanation: Each position in the keyword can have 52 distinct letters, and each position contributes independently, so 52^n possibilities (10-30 words)

4b. Is the problem 2 cipher stronger than the original Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: Each letter uses a random transposition despite their depedency on the first key, and unique punctuation handling increases complexity (10-20 words)

4c. Will encrypting the space help address the weaknesses of the Caesar cipher?
  Answer: Yes (Yes/No)
  Explanation: Encrypting whitespaces hides word boundaries making guessing patterns more difficult and deciphering the transposition shifts harder (10-20 words)
